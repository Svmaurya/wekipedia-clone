  <p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</b>GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5
    February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League
    club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo
    has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Best Player in Europe, and four European Golden Shoes,
    the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA
    Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most
    appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14),
    international goals (123) and international appearances (200). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100
    professional career appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country, making
    him the highest goalscorer of all time.</p>

  <p>Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup
    in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and
    the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive
    association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million).
    He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to
    the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won
    back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel
    Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in
    the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and
    2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and
    three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million),
    the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two
    Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the
    first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester
    United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022.
    In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.</p>
  <p>Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned 200 caps, making
    him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognized by the Guinness World Records.[9] With
    more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and
    scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal
    reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best
    Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their
    first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the
    tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the
    inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden
    Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.

    <br><br> One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete
    by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him
    on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third
    sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.

  <h2>Early life</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of
    the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[10][11] He is the fourth and
    youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener
    and part-time kit,<sup>[12]</sup> His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island
    of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[13] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia
    "Katia".[14] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[15] His mother
    revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already,
    but her doctor refused to perform the procedure,[16][17] as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time.[18]
    Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[19]

      alt="ronaldo">
    <br><br> As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[20] where his father was the kit man,[12] and
    later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him
    for a fee of £1,500.[21] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth
    academy.[21] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother
    to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[22] With a troubled life as a student[23] and living in Lisbon
    area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[24][25] While popular with
    other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected"
    him.[22] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up
    playing football.[26] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways
    into one, altering his resting heart rate.[27] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and
    resumed training a few days later.[28]

    alt="prize">
  <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed
    with his dribbling.[29] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and
    under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[21] A year later, on 29 September 2002,
    Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense
    in their 3–0 win.[30] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool
    manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[31] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in
    signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[32]

    <br><br> Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently,
    after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially,
    United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[33] Having been impressed by him, the
    United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[33] for
    what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[34] A decade after his departure
    from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[35]
  </p>
  <h3>Manchester United</h3>
  <h4>003–2007: Development and breakthrough</h4>
  <p></p>Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield
  but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first
  Portuguese player to sign for the club.[37] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in
  English football history.[38] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad
  number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David
  Beckham.[39] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[40] A key element in his
  development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport,
  one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[41]
  <p>Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August
    2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[42] His performance earned praise from Best,
    who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[36] Ronaldo scored his first goal for
    Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[43] Three more league goals followed
    in the second half of the campaign,[44] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a
    match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[45] Ronaldo ended his first season in English
    football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first
    trophy.[46] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[47] The British press had been critical
    of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[48] but teammate Gary
    Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[49]
  </p>
  <p>Ronaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to
    Middlesbrough.[50] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two
    years to 2010.[51] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a
    goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[52][53] He played the full 120
    minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his
    attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5–4.[54] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the
    Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[55]

    <br><br> During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban
    imposed on him by UEFA for a "one-fingered gesture" towards Benfica fans,[56] and was sent off in the Manchester
    derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[57] Ronaldo clashed with a
    teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[58] Following the
    2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[59]
    Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the
    incident.[60] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[61]

    <br><br> Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07
    season,[62] it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first
    Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René
    Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and
    capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals
    for which he was already known.[63] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa
    (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[64][65][66] Ronaldo was named the Premier League
    Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[67]
  </p>
  <h4>2007–2008: Collective and individual success</h4>
  <p>At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match
    in the competition,[68] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma.[69] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first
    semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[70] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0
    at the San Siro.[71] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0
    defeat.[72] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United
    won their first league title in four years.[73] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal
    awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young
    Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[74][75]
    becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[76] His wages were raised to £120,000 a week as
    part of a five-year contract extension.[77] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,[78] and
    came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[79]

    <br><br> Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008,
    which put United top of the league table.[80] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over
    Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.[81] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George
    Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[82] His
    31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[83] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him
    the first winger to win the latter award.[84] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA
    Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[85][86] In the knockout stage of the Champions
    League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on
    aggregate;[87] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma.[88] United
    reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser
    and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[89] United emerged victorious 1–1, winning the penalties
    6–5.[90][91] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[92]

    <br><br> Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific
    campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of
    the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[93] As rumours circulated of
    Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over
    Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[94] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted
    that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as "modern slavery".[95] Despite
    Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[96] he remained at United for another year.[97]
  </p>
  <h3>Real Madrid</h3>
  <p>Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80 million
    (€94 million).[114] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion
    buy-out clause.[115] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year
    record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[116] Since club captain Raúl already wore the
    number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[117] which was presented to him
    by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[118]</p>
